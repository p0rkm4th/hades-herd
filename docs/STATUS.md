## Works

- The dependency-free Python helper discovers a live Herd catalog and
  generates a dedicated Codex profile.
- Fish `codex-herd` supports exact model selection, per-model preferences,
  catalog refresh, and explicit errors for stale or unknown model names.
- The private HADES deployment was last observed with all seven backends online;
  this is point-in-time evidence, not a public service-health guarantee.
- MiMo-V2.6 9B Q4 completed HTTPie #1960's header-order fix and test through
  Codex/Herd in about 126 seconds. Independent verification passed 122 tests
  with 3 expected xfails. This is one successful task, not daily-driver proof.

## Not yet dependable

- MiMo and Qwen3.8 each timed out on the same bounded Rich #4250 task without
  edits; the Qwen run made two shell calls and generated near 11 tokens/s.
  These results point to an execution/progress problem on this task, not a
  general intelligence ranking.
- Qwen3.8 has successful task-specific 8K registry and multi-file results, but
  many distinct 16K Codex attempts did not complete a full agent turn.
- Earlier traces include unsupported `read_file` attempts, repeated source
  inspection, patches without a final response, and test-fixture errors.
- Codex reasoning controls are not yet demonstrated end-to-end through Herd's
  adapter. Do not claim `reasoning.effort` or Ollama `think` settings apply.
- No profile meets the 20 varied-task / 85% pass@1 daily-driver gate.

## Current decision

Keep the deployed default unchanged. Use local profiles experimentally with
independent patch review. The immediate engineering work is protocol tracing,
inspection-loop diagnosis, runner validation, and a minimal controlled fix—not
adding models or changing production routes.
